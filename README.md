> How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Service workers relates to graceful degradation in that it helps make the "degradation" part of graceful degradation be more "graceful". That is, when things break functionality wise (i.e. when there is no internet), service workers help to make the app continue working. They also help speed up the app when things are working through caching, which adds another way of making the process of graceful degradation more smooth.
